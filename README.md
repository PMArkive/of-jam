# This project is deprecated.
OFtoast 1, or rei, or jam has been deprecated due to easier and more maintainable options being available (namely murse with a batch file).

I may re-write it, or update it to some point of usability as a form of reference TVN frontend in Python in the future; however nothing is certain, and this won't occur before OFtoast II's completion. I'm however leaving the repository un-archived in case anyone else wants to fix it (and submit a PR).

I'd like to thank everyone who worked on it, especially Bryson, a lot was learnt during the development and the time this was in use.

original read me:
# of-jam (formerly oflauncher-rei) 
Open Fortress frontend that utilises TVN.

You're going to need to install the [Toast](http://github.com/int-72h/toast), and everything in requirements.txt.
